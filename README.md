This is a C++ based simulation of robotic combat within a virtual battlefield,
highlighting the interactions between various classes of robots with distinct abilities.
Designed to test and enhance their strategic and operational capabilities, the simulation
operates in a controlled grid-based environment.

The core components include different types of robots such as RoboCops, Terminators,
TerminatorRoboCops, BlueThunders, Madbots, RoboTanks, and UltimateRobots. Each class
has unique attributes and behaviors influencing their combat performance. Some robots can
move, others can shoot, and some can perform both actions while detecting enemies nearby.
The battlefield is a 2D grid where robots navigate, engage, and adapt to combat outcomes.
The simulation employs object-oriented programming principles, featuring classes for each
robot type, a battlefield class to manage the grid, and utility classes for robot actions and
upgrades.

The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of different robotic strategies and
decision-making processes under combat conditions. Robots can be upgraded based on
performance, adding complexity and adaptation. The system tracks kills, lives, and upgrades,
offering insights into how robots evolve and improve tactics over time.
